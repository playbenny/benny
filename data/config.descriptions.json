	"MAX_AUDIO_INPUTS" : 18,
	"MAX_AUDIO_OUTPUTS" : 24,
	"AUDIO_TO_DATA_DOWNSAMPLE" : "this mostly affects the minimum scope zoom and how smooth the scopes look. the default 1 is the best appearance, reducing the amount of samples taken (eg 4 or 8) gives a ~20% cpu use reduction on large patches on low end systems.",
