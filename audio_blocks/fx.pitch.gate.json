Waclaw was using the m4l version of this with a mic inside the barrel of his clarinet, which gives a very clean signal that works well.££in single voice mode output 1 is the 'selected notes' and output 2 is the 'unselected notes'. ££if multiple voices are instantiated then each voice only selects / unselects one note from the list of available ones.££as with the fx.pitch.retune block you set the notes you want either using notepools (defined in the core.scales.shapes block) or midi input.££the midi outputs give you (on 1) the detected pitch and (on 2) the gate status of the voice, which you could use to drive an envelope, for example.",
