block json file reference
-------------------------

json doesn't support comments, so i've listed the keys and interspersed explanations. copy them
out into your own json files, removing all my comments.

use an editor that will check the syntax of json for you, it'll save you time. vscode is free and does the job.

the whole thing is in {}, and contains one key, which is named as the block name, 
and the json file has to be saved as the same name too. eg this example is based on utility.delay.json

{
	"utility.delay" : { //the block name. '.' and '+' make newlines in the block labels
        //if you want your own prefix (eg my friend luke starts the name of all his blocks with abb.)
        //benny will automatically add a new section to the end of the blocks page. you can reorder
        //the sections editing userconfig.json
		"patcher" : "utility.delay",   //the name of the max patch for a voice of your block
		"type" : "audio",  //audio, or note. in the hw config file "hardware" is a possibility.
		"block_ui_patcher" : "blank.ui", //write "blank.ui" unless it has a separate ui drawing max patch
        //in which case write the name here. 
        //OR if you write "self" then benny lets you pop open the voice's max patch so you can
        // build your block a UI in a separate max window rather than inside benny if you prefer.
		//ui keys:
        "ui_in_sidebar_height" : 1, //if this key is present it draws the ui in the sidebar above the parameters, using this many rows of space. your ui can adjust to proportions if you want it to...
        "ui_in_sidebar_expands" : 1,
        "ui_to_bottom_panel" : 1, //let this be sent to the bottom panel. the 5th setup param (x,y,x,y,M) is called with a '2' so you know to render a long thin view. very much only for a particular kind of block - like mix bus, pattern sequencer, etc.
        "no_ui_in_panel" : 1,//this key prevents it displaying the ui in the panels page of benny
		"no_edit" : 1,//this key prevents the ui being popped open from the sidebar/panels - it can't be made the main focus of the window ever.
		"help_text" : "the help text is displayed under 'help' and in the blocks menu",
		"synonyms" : "bbd", //other words that you want it to show up under when people type to search - 
        // eg, my fx.delay.buckets i think of as a bbd even though that's not in the name so i want it to come up if i type bbd..
		"max_polyphony" : 0, //0=unlimited polyphony, 1-... = sets a hard limit on how many voices are allowed
		"upsample" : 1, //[OPTIONAL, AUDIO BLOCKS ONLY]does it default to upsampling, if so how many x 
        
		    //the subvoices keys work like this: normal blocks 1 voice is 1 channel, with a mod input
            //and a second output. some blocks though, a voice has (eg) pairs of ins and outs, like for
            //example a stereo vst.
            //this influences default ways it considers wiring the blocks up, as well as the display.
            //some rare blocks have one kind of ins and one kind of outs. you can set those - see the examples
            //underneath, but you have to still set subvoices = 2. an example of this is a mono input-ed stereo
            //panner block
